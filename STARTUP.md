# Running Chronicle Storage Service

Please review README.md included in this repository for information on how to get started with contributing.

At this point, our batch has been running chronicle on our own machines using a local application server.
To start your application, ensure you have the latest repo for [chronicle-front](https://github.com/Batch-908-AugustDuet/chronicle-front) and [chronicle-storage-service](https://github.com/Batch-908-AugustDuet/chronicle-storage-service)

Then follow the README.md for each of the separate repositories to set up your IDE.
 NOTE: Both the java application and the angular application must be running for the application to properly work.

Defaults are localhost:4200 for the angular application and localhost:8080 for the java application.
